Bioinformatics Revision
=======================

Intro
-----

This repo is for the dual purpose of revising Bioinformatics (for exams) and
learning markdown. I will be using markdown to make slides/pdfs of my notes
and hopefully it'll turn out to be useful.

Contents
--------

The bioinformatics course will be broken down into two large sections:

* Classes of Algorithms (e.g. Dynamic Programming)
* Standalone Biology Facts & Theory (e.g. Mass Spec)

Classes of Algorithms will be further broken down:

* Class of Algorithm
    + Individual Algorithm
        - Biology Intro
        - Problem
        - Solution
        - Pseudocode
